Compiling FFMPEG 18966

1-install minWG
2-install MSys
3-replace the make in MSys with a make version 3.81
4-run the msys
	1-go to ffmpeg path
	2-./configure --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-memalign-hack --extra-cflags="-fno-common" --disable-debug
	3-make 
	4-make install

5-search for the dlls and .a files in the ffmpeg directory
6-rename the .a files to .lib files and remove the "lib" prefix 
7-copy the required dlls and libs and the include files to the desired directory
8- the include files can be found in the msys/local/include directory
9- recompile your project.

At phase 6 you may need to use the MSVC "lib" tool to create the
"*.lib" files, since gcc may fail to do this in an MSVC-compatible
way, resulting in warnings like:

libavcodec.a(utils.o) : warning LNK4078: multiple '.text' sections
found with different attributes (E0000020)
