   GUIDE FOR CONFIGURING FFMPEG TO BE USED WITH MULTITUDE/MULTITOUCH

Multitude expects FFMPEG that is compiled as a shared library. As we
are dealing in various jurisdictions, it makes sense to pay attention
to potential IP problems. Whenever we distribute the FFMPEG library,
we make sure that we distribute a version which is 1) licensed under
the LGPL, and 2) does not contain any patented algorithms. The
recipient of the software may rebuild the FFMPEG in a different way,
and use that version, without recompiling anything.


Here are two handy commands for setting up FFMPEG, depending on your
conditions.

1) For minimal IP-problems, this is used for creating libs that we
distribute:

./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared --disable-encoders --disable-decoders --enable-decoder=mjpeg --enable-decoder=vorbis --enable-decoder=theora  --enable-decoder=pcm_s16le --enable-decoder=pcm_s16be --enable-decoder=pcm_s8 --enable-decoder=wav  --disable-bsfs

The ffmpeg library will still contain parsers/muxers for various
formats with patent restrictions. How-ever, the decoders that would
really infringe on someones patents are removed.


2) For maximal decoding capability, this is useful if you can use the
relevant decoders legally.

./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/ --enable-libfaad --enable-libfaac --enable-gpl  --enable-liba52 --enable-libgsm --enable-libxvid
