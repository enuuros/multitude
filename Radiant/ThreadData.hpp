  /** Thread-specific data holder. This class is used to hold
      thread-specific data. Any thread can place data to the holder. The
      holder has a list of data objects, with corresponding thread
      ids. Thus a caller only gets the data that is specific to that
      particular thread. 

      Keep in mind that one must be careful with how the data is
      organized. The data type must have a default constructor and copy
      operator. If you wish to use data objects that do not have these
      features, then your best bet is to store only pointers to the data
      here.

      This class is completely thread-safe. It uses an internal mutex to
      prevent simultaneous modifications from multiple threads.
