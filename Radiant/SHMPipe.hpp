  /** One-directional shared-memory data pipe. This type of a pipe is
      used to transfer (binary) data between two separate
      processes.

      <B>Hint:</B> Often it is easiest to format the data using one
      #BinaryData as the data container, as #BinaryData allows easy
      storage of integers, floats, strings etc, without too much
      overhead.

      <B>Internally</B> the pipe works as a ring buffer, that has a read- and
      write position. The producer process writes bytes into the
      buffer, and once the write is complete the write head is
      updated. The writer observes the read head location so that it
      does not overwrite data that has not been read yet.
