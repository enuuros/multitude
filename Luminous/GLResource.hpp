  class GLResources;

  /// Abstract base class for OpenGL resource objects
  /** This class is used to represent arbitrary OpenGL resources per
      OpenGL context. 

      GLResource is used for two purposes:

      1) It used to store OpenGL resource handles (texture- FBO-, VBO-
      identifiers etc) so that they can be deleted after when the
      object that needs them is to be deleted. This feature is
      necessary in threaded rendering, where one thread is used to run
      application logic and other threads do the actual rendering.


      2) Keep track of OpenGL resource usage. Individual resource
      object can notify the host system about their OpenGL memory
      usage, which is useful for avoiding out-of-memory
      situations. For example textures can be thrown out of the GPU
      memory more aggressively if the system is running out of GPU
      memory.

      A typical way to use this class is that you derive classes from
      this one. The derived class can include more than one OpenGL
      resource, depending on how you need to use them.

      

      <PRE>

      MyWidget is the object that uses OpenGL resources

      class MyWidget : public Widget
      {
      public:

        MyResource is used so that these resources can be freed after
        the actual MyWidget object has been deleted.

        class MyResource : GLResource
	{
	public:
	  bool load();
	
          The three resources below are used for tracking OpenGL
          memory usage.

	  Texture2D m_tex1;
	  Texture2D m_tex2;
	  GPUTextureFont m_font;
	};

	
	MyWidget(GarbageCollector * collector)
          : Widget(collector)
	{}

	virtual void update()
	{
	  Needs to access style sheet
	  Needs to access font layout information
	}

	virtual void render(GLResources * resources)
	{
	  This function probably needs to access style sheet

	  MyResource * rs = dynamic_cast<MyResource *>
	    (resources->getResource(this));
	  if(!rs) {
	    rs = new MyResource;
	    rs->load();

            These three are needed for GPU memory tracking

	    rs->m_tex1.setResources(resources);
	    rs->m_tex2.setResources(resources);
	    rs->m_font.setResources(resources);
	    resources->addResource(this, rs);
	  }
	  
	  Do stuff using "rs"
	}

	CPUTextureFont m_font;
