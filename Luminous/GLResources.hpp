  /// Collection of OpenGL-context -specific resources (textures, FBOs etc).
  /** This class is also used to store information about how much
      resources are used (texture, FBO -memory etc).

      This object also keeps track of change history in
      allocation/deallocation sums. This information is handy when you
      want to make sure that you do not push too many texture pixels
      to the GPU during one frame etc.
      
      The GLResource objects are deleted if they are too old -
      i.e. not used for some time. The old objects are only deleted
      when the GPU RAM usage exceeds given threshold. By default the
      threshold is 70MB, but it can be changed by setting environment
      variable MULTI_GPU_RAM to a numeric value that represents the
      number of GPU megabytes that one allowed to use. The value can
      also be changed programmatically, using the setComfortableGPURAM
      function.

      For example setting MULTI_GPU_RAM to 200, GLResources starts to
      drop old resources from GPU as the GPU RAM usage exceeds 200MB.
