  /** Class for doing key-stone correction when rendering 2D OpenGL
      graphics. The key-stone matrix is a 4x4 trnasformation matrix
      that is setup up to transform the corner points of all
      polygons/lines/sprites so that they match some skewed coordinate
      system.

      This class is used to do keystone correction by applying an
      OpenGL transformation matrix that skews the output to match
      display geometry imperfections. It is typically used in
      projector-based systems where aligning the projectors physically
      is either impossible or very difficult.
