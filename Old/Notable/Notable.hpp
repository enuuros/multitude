/**
  * Notable is a collection of C++ classes created by Dave Pomerantz to
  * facilitate thread-safe message passing between autonomous objects.
  * Full documentation and code samples are available from the Target
  * Software website http://www.targetsoft.com
  *
  * Please note that for this implementation the source code has been
  * modified to make it generic (the original is Windows specific),
  * and that class and function names have been changed to make them
  * consistent with the rest of the MultiTouch API. Thus, for example,
  * Hungarian prefixes have been removed, and variable and function names
  * begin with lower-case characters.
