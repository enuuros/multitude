	better support reference counting (if the caller would use

        Q: Why is the argument type not "const Nimble::Vector2 &",
        that would be faster or not ?

        A: Tha would be slower. We live in (mostly) 64-bit world. The
        Vector2 takes 8 bytes as would the reference (which is really
        a pointer in hardware level). So the effort to just copy the
        object equals the effort to make reference to it. To access
        that variable in the member function a reference would need
        another step of memory access, while here can just access the
        variable directly. There are also pointer aliasing issues that
        are better handled with this aproach.
