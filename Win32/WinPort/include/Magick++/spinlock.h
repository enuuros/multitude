  ImageMagick Spinlock  Methods. These are highly lightweight functions that
  are used to prevent deadlocks on access to global data when the normal
  semaphore system has not yet been initialized. They are intended to only
  be used to protect operations that are very fast - like a flag that tells
  you that something has been inited, or bumping a counter. Do NOT use this
  for protecting an operation that will take any significant amount of time.
