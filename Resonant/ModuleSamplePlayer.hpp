  /** Audio sample player for Resonant.

      This class implements a basic sample player, which can be used
      as a minimal synthesizer.


      <B>Memory management:</B> The samples (aka audio files)
      are read from the disk as they are needed. The samples are loaded when they
      are first used. To force the loading of a particular sample, you can
      play the sample with zero volume. Samples are never dropped away from the
      RAM which may cause memory usage issues if the application is using a lot
      sound files.

        should be in the 20-30 second range. The end result will be a
        nice ambient background that does not sound like it is
        looping.

        @arg network The DSP network to attach the ambient sound player to.

        @arg filename The name of the audio sample file.

        @arg gain The gain coefficient for playback. Setting gain to one
        plays the file back at the original volume.

        @arg relpitch The pitch for the playback. If the pitch is set to one,
        then the file will play back at the original speed. With pitch of 0.5
        the file will play back one octave below original pitch, and last
        twice as long as nominal file duration.

        @arg targeChannel Select the channel where the sound is going to.
        For example in 8-channel environment, this parameter can range from zero
        to seven.

        @arg loop Turns of looping if necessary. With looping the sample will play
        back for-ever.
